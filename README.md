# About

## A collection of various PowerShell commands that I thought would be useful for this role. 

I have also included some commands related to topics that came up during the interviews. Each code block can be run indepenently or all at once. The majority do not require any elevated permissions. Any commands that do require admin privileges are noted in the comments. 

Required Modules: 
- ActiveDirectory
- MSOnline
- ExchangeOnlineManagement
